The decision clearly spells out the reasons for which the borrower has been declared as willful defaulter vis-a-vis RBI guidelines.  (iii) The borrower is thereafter suitably advised about the proposal to classify him as willful defaulter along with the reasons therefor.  The concerned borrower is provided reasonable time (say 15 days) for making representation against such decision, if he so desires, to a Grievance Redressal Committee headed by the Chairman and Managing Director and consisting of two other senior officials. (iv) The Committee gives a hearing to the borrower if he represents that he has been wrongly classified as willful defaulter.  (v) A final declaration as ‘wilful defaulter’ is made after a view is taken by the Committee on the representation and the borrower is suitably advised.  As per the circular, action including punitive action is initiated against such willful defaulters.

MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) IN THE MINISTRY OF COAL, POWERAND NEW AND RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): Yes, Madam.(b)to(d): The guidelines on “The  New Coal DistributionPolicy” (NCDP) were  issued by Government of India on18.10.2007 for distribution and pricing of Coal tovarious sector.As per para 2.2 of the said policy, Power Utilities wereto be supplied 100 per cent of the quantity as per theirnormative requirement through Fuel Supply Agreements(FSAs) by Coal India Limited (CIL) at fixed prices tobe declared / notified by Coal India Limited(CIL). Andas per para 5.2, in order to meet the domestic requirementof coal, CIL was to import coal as required from time totime, if feasible and adjust its overall price accordingly.Government vide instructions dated 26.07.2013 has approveda revised arrangement for supply of coal to the identifiedThermal Power Stations (TPPs) of 78,000 MW capacity commi-ssioned or likely to be commissioned during the period from01.04.2009 to 31.03.2015. Taking into account the overalldomestic availability and the likely actual requirementsof these TPPs, it has been decided that FSAs will be signedfor the domestic coal quantity of 65%, 65%, 67% and 75% ofACQ for 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively,for the power plants having normal coal linkages. Cases oftapering linkage would get coal supplies as per the TaperingLinkage Policy. To meet its balance FSA obligations towardsthe requirement of the said 78,000 MW TPPs, CIL may importcoal and supply the same to the willing power plants on costplus basis. Power plants may also directly import coal them-selves, if they so opt, in which case, the FSA obligationson the part of CIL to the extent of import component wouldbe deemed to have been discharged.In view of the above, Para 2.2 and 5.2 of the New CoalDistribution Policy dated 18.10.2007 stand modified tothe above extent.And further, taking into consideration the cases ofproject developers who could not achieve the milestoneswithin the validity period of Letter of Assurance(LoA)due to reasons beyond their control, Government videamendment dated 04.09.2013, replaced existing entryat para 6.4 of NCDP with the following:-“LoA will be valid for a period of 12/24 months as applicable,during which the applicant consumer / LoA holder will berequired to achieve the milestones pertaining to his projects/plant as stipulated in the LoA, failing which LoA will beliable to be cancelled and the Earnest Money / CommitmentGuarantee will be liable to be forfeited. However, thevalidity period of LoA can be extended by the competentauthority on the recommendation of SLC (LT)”.                                                    ",10036

The Government of India has app-roved Master Plans for dealing with fire, subsidence,rehabilitation of persons living in unsafe areas anddiversion of surface infrastructure of the Jharia coal-field (JCF) within the leasehold of Bharat Coking CoalLimited (BCCL). As per the approved Master plan, appro-ximately 37.00 MT of coal had been blocked due to firein the past.WCL: The year-wise list of such incidences of spontaneousheating / mine fire that occurred in the mines of WCLduring the last three years and current year along withthe reason of occurrence is enclosed in Annexure “A”.As spontaneous heating / underground mine fires in themines of WCL are localized in nature, even if the partof the mine is temporarily sealed-off for some periodfor safety reasons, such sealed-off panels are reopenedafter heating / fire is controlled. There after coal isextracted from these panels.(c) & (d): Details regarding BCCL and WCL are as under:BCCL: Master plan was prepared by CMPDIL in 2009 fordealing with fire, subsidence and rehabilitation hasbeen approved by the Govt. of India. In this plancomprehensive Action for dealing with fire has beenplanned. BCCL, as per the Master plan, had made effortsfor controlling the fires by various methods like (1)Excavation the fiery coal seam. (2) At other places sandflushing, blanketing, trench cutting, liquid nitrogenflushing etc. has also been used.WCL: On detection of mine fire / spontaneous heating, theaffected part of the mine is isolated / sealed-off. Asspontaneous heating / underground mine fires in the minesof WCL are localized in nature, even if the entire mine istemporarily sealed-off for some period of time for safetyreasons, such sealed-off panels are reopened after heating/fire is controlled. Thereafter coal is extracted from thesepanels.(e): Details regarding BCCL and WCL are as under:BCCL: Since, the existing fires in Jharia Coalfield ofBCCL are being dealt systematically in scientific mannerin form of different fire projects formulated under theapproved Master Plan, there is no loss expected duringcurrent financial year.WCL: As spontaneous heating / underground mine fires inthe mines of WCL are localized in nature, even if theentire mine is temporarily sealed-off for some periodof time for safety reasons, such sealed-off panels arereopened after heating / fire is controlled. There aftertemporarily locked coal due to such fires / spontaneousheating is extracted from these panels. Though thesecould be delays in the project, no loss is expectedduring the current financial year.(f): The following steps being taken / proposed to betaken to save the coal reserves from such fires in BCCLand WCL.BCCL: As per the Master Plan, BCCL adopted a StrategicPlan in 2008 in which it was decided to excavate out fireaffected areas by Open Cast Mining. This strategy of diggingout fiery coal was implemented with remarkable success.As per latest report of NRSC, ISRO, Deptt. of Space,Hyderabad., the fire area has reduced to 2.18 sq.km.from 9.00 sq.km.WCL: The following important measures are taken in themines of WCL to prevent incidents of underground spontaneousheating / mine fire:(i) Spot sampling of air and analysis of the same is beingdone in all the underground mines as per statute.Tele-monitoring System is installed in six underground minesof Western Coalfields Limited (viz. BC 3&4, DRC, NMC-III,Mahakali UG, HLC-1 and Sasti UG) for continuous monitoringof mine environment.(ii) Mines are operated strictly as per approved MiningPlan prepared with scientific methods of mining andtechnologies.(iii) Risk assessment based Safety Management Plans havebeen prepared for all mines of CIL where all hazardsincluding that of mine fire are being identified scien-tifically and appropriate control measures are recommendedand implemented.(iv) Proper stacking of coal in coal dump to prevent heating.

MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) IN THE MINISTRY OFCOAL, POWER AND NEW AND RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): India has adequate coal reserves for meeting its coalrequirements and as such these reserves would be adequateto meet the coal requirement at the present demand level.However, at the present juncture, the actual production ofcoal falls short of the overall demand. Accordingly, the gapbetween total consumption and domestic supply is being metthrough import of coal.  The import of non-coking coal inthe country has increased from 48.6 Mte. in 2009-10 to131.3 Mte.in 2013-14.(b)&(c): The Coal India Limited (CIL) has been investing inexploration and the expenditure incurred during the last threeyears was Rs. 161.25 crores in 2011-12, Rs. 138.63 crores in2012-13 and Rs. 310.02 crores in 2013-14.  CIL has been ableto drill 4.98 lakh meters, 5.62 lakh meters and 6.69 lakhmeters respectively during these three years. Because of thedetailed exploration undertaken by CIL, about 3-4 billiontonnes of coal reserves is being added each year to the provedcategory of coal reserves in the country. However, the pace ofexploration has been constrained due to limitation on the bore-holes in areas under forest cover and also due to law & orderproblems prevailing in some areas.(d): The focus of the Government is to increase coal productionto the maximum extent possible by facilitating Environment &Forest clearances expeditiously, pursuing with State Governmentfor assistance in land acquisition and coordinated efforts withRailways for movement of coal.

These programmes presently cover polluted stretchesof 42 rivers in 199 towns of 21 States at a sanctioned costof Rs.11083.42 crore. Interception and diversion of raw sewage,and setting up of sewage treatment plants (STPs) are the corecomponents taken up under NRCP and NGRBA. Sewage treatmentcapacity of 4992 million litres per day (mld) has been createdso far under the two programmes.In addition, State Governments, apart from their own budgetaryallocations, are also accessing financial assistance for creationof sewerage infrastructure, including STPs, in various cities/towns under other Central Sector Schemes of Ministry of UrbanDevelopment.According to the report published by Central Pollution ControlBoard (CPCB) in December, 2009, the installed sewage treatmentcapacity of STPs in Class-I cities and Class-II towns is 11787mld, against an estimated sewage generation of 38254 mld. Also,as reported, there are 269 STPs in the country, including 211STPs in Class-I cities and 31 in Class-II towns.During the period 2010-11, CPCB has carried out performancestudy of 152 STPs funded under NRCP and NGRBA programmes. Outof these, 63 STPs were found complying with the prescribedstandards, 48 STPs were not complying, 32 STPs were found notoperational and 9 were under construction. The utilizationcapacity was reported as 66%. The State Governments andimplementing agencies take corrective measures to ensurecapacity utilization of STPs, which include creation ofsewerage infrastructure including house connections, properoperation and maintenance, back-up power arrangement, etc.CPCB and respective State Pollution Control Boards/PollutionControl Committees monitor STPs with respect to dischargestandards and take action for non-compliance under the Water(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Envi-ronment (Protection) Act, 1986.

ANSWER                                                                                                                                                            MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI JAYANT SINHA)(a): There is no evidence to support the contention that futures / forward trading is responsible for inflation. The commodity futures market is a mechanism for price discovery and price risk management.  The price of any commodity is determined by actual demand and supply position in the market. The futures market merely discovers the likely prices of a given commodity at future points of time depending on the expectations of supply and demand. Besides, many commodities such as onion, fruits, vegetables (other than potato), eggs, fish or other perishables are not traded in the futures market. Several studies/ reports, such as the Abhijit Sen Committee Report (2008) and the Annual Report of the Reserve Bank of India (2009-10) have concluded that forward/ futures trading is not responsible for inflation. An independent study in 2012 by Dr. Ashok Gulati has also reported that during the period from 1995-96 to December 2012, three factors explain the price rise (inflation) in the Food Articles Index (FAI), in India i.e. fiscal deficit, global food inflation and domestic farm wages.(b): The Forward Markets Commission, set up in 1953 under the provisions of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 (FCRA), regulate forward and futures trading in commodities. There is no proposal for setting up any other regulatory authority for regulating future/ forward trading, under the consideration of the Government. (c): As per the provision of FCRA, functions of the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) are as follows:(i) To advise the Central Government in respect of the recognition or the withdrawal of recognition from any association or in respect of any other matter arising out of the administration of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952. (ii) To keep forward markets under observation and to take such action in relation to them, as it may consider necessary, in exercise of the powers assigned to it by or under the Act. (iii) To collect and whenever the Commission thinks it necessary, to publish information regarding the trading conditions in respect of goods to which any of the provisions of the Act is made applicable, including information regarding supply, demand and prices, and to submit to the Central Government, periodical reports on the working of forward markets relating to such goods; (iv) To make recommendations generally with a view to improving the organization and working of forward markets; (v) To undertake the inspection of the accounts and other documents of any recognized association or registered association or any member of such association whenever it considers it necessary. The FMC has taken several initiatives for improving price discovery and price risk management through regulatory and developmental measures. The commodity futures market has made progress in terms of trading volumes, robustness of clearing and settlement, bouquets of products available for trading and governance of exchanges. However, an analysis of futures trading data by a committee set up by Ministry of Finance (which submitted its report in April, 2014), it was observed that futures market is fairing relatively well on price discovery and relatively poor on hedging effectiveness. It has suggested that a diverse array of firms such as banks, foreign entities, other financial institutions should be permitted to participate in the commodity futures market which would improve liquidity and hedging effectiveness. (d) & (e): No Sir. Forward trading has been conducted in the past, on the platform of the regional exchanges and regulated under the provisions of the FCRA.  FMC has recently approved trading in delivery-based forward contracts in Sugar and Maize on the platform of a national level exchange. Forward trading in agricultural commodities through the exchange platform facilitates participation of physical market players and much better price discovery in the market. This is also expected to gradually reduce the cost of intermediation in the physical market which would help both the sellers and buyers of these commodities.

The commodity futures market is a mechanism for price discovery and price risk management.  The price of any commodity is determined by actual demand and supply position in the market. The futures market merely discovers the likely prices of a given commodity at future points of time depending on the expectations of supply and demand. Besides, many commodities such as onion, fruits, vegetables (other than potato), eggs, fish or other perishables are not traded in the futures market. Several studies/ reports, such as the Abhijit Sen Committee Report (2008) and the Annual Report of the Reserve Bank of India (2009-10) have concluded that forward/ futures trading is not responsible for inflation. An independent study in 2012 by Dr. Ashok Gulati has also reported that during the period from 1995-96 to December 2012, three factors explain the price rise (inflation) in the Food Articles Index (FAI), in India i.e. fiscal deficit, global food inflation and domestic farm wages.(b): The Forward Markets Commission, set up in 1953 under the provisions of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 (FCRA), regulate forward and futures trading in commodities. There is no proposal for setting up any other regulatory authority for regulating future/ forward trading, under the consideration of the Government. (c): As per the provision of FCRA, functions of the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) are as follows:(i) To advise the Central Government in respect of the recognition or the withdrawal of recognition from any association or in respect of any other matter arising out of the administration of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952. (ii) To keep forward markets under observation and to take such action in relation to them, as it may consider necessary, in exercise of the powers assigned to it by or under the Act. (iii) To collect and whenever the Commission thinks it necessary, to publish information regarding the trading conditions in respect of goods to which any of the provisions of the Act is made applicable, including information regarding supply, demand and prices, and to submit to the Central Government, periodical reports on the working of forward markets relating to such goods; (iv) To make recommendations generally with a view to improving the organization and working of forward markets; (v) To undertake the inspection of the accounts and other documents of any recognized association or registered association or any member of such association whenever it considers it necessary. The FMC has taken several initiatives for improving price discovery and price risk management through regulatory and developmental measures. The commodity futures market has made progress in terms of trading volumes, robustness of clearing and settlement, bouquets of products available for trading and governance of exchanges. However, an analysis of futures trading data by a committee set up by Ministry of Finance (which submitted its report in April, 2014), it was observed that futures market is fairing relatively well on price discovery and relatively poor on hedging effectiveness. It has suggested that a diverse array of firms such as banks, foreign entities, other financial institutions should be permitted to participate in the commodity futures market which would improve liquidity and hedging effectiveness. (d) & (e): No Sir. Forward trading has been conducted in the past, on the platform of the regional exchanges and regulated under the provisions of the FCRA.  FMC has recently approved trading in delivery-based forward contracts in Sugar and Maize on the platform of a national level exchange.

All the active Magstripe international cards issued by banks should have threshold limit for international usage. The threshold should be determined by the banks based on the risk profile of the customer and accepted by the customer. Till such time this process is completed an omnibus threshold limit (say, not exceeding USD 500) as determined by each bank may be put in place for all debit cards and all credit cards that have not been used for international transactions in the past. #   All new card present infrastructures has to be enabled for both EMV chip and PIN and Aadhaar (biometric validation) acceptance (November 26, 2013; these instructions have been put on hold awaiting the feedback from the industry through Indian Banks Association)(C)  GENERAL MEASURES#  Online alerts for all types of card transaction irrespective of the channels and the amount (March 29, 2011)(D)  Securing electronic payment transactions (February 28, 2013):#  Customer induced options may be provided for fixing a cap on the value / mode of transactions/beneficiaries.
